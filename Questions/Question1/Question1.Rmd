Economists recently pointed out that the current yield spreads in local mid to longer dated bond yields have since 2020 been the highest in decades. Using the data on SA Bonds, this report conducts an analysis of the current yield spreads in the local bond market that places the current high spreads into historical context.

```{r}
##Load in Data
SA_bonds <- read_rds("data/SA_Bonds.rds")
BE_Infl <- read_rds("data/BE_Infl.rds")
bonds_2y <- read_rds("data/bonds_2y.rds")
bonds_10y <- read_rds("data/bonds_10y.rds")
usdzar <- read_rds("data/usdzar.rds")
ZA_Infl <- read_rds("data/ZA_Infl.rds")
IV <- read_rds("data/IV.rds")
```


Lets start our analysis with looking at the yield spreads over the different dated SA bonds.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

SA_bonds_clean <- SA_bonds %>%  
                
    arrange(date) %>% 
    
    gather(Ticker, Yield, -date) %>% 
    
    tbl2xts::tbl_xts(cols_to_xts = Yield, spread_by = Ticker) %>% 
    
    tbl2xts::xts_tbl() %>% gather(Ticker, Yield, -date)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

SA_Bond_All <- SA_bonds_clean %>% 
    
                ggplot() +
    
                geom_line(aes(date, Yield, color = Ticker)) +
               
  
  # Nice clean theme, with many additions that are now simplified (explore this yourself):
  # E.g. using fmxdat::ggpts, we can change the sizes more easily in millimeters. 
  # theme_fmx also offers simplified size settings, as e.g. below:
  
  fmxdat::theme_fmx(title.size = ggpts(30),
                    
                    subtitle.size = ggpts(28),
                    
                    caption.size = ggpts(25),
                    
                    CustomCaption = T) + 
  
  # crisp colours:
  fmxdat::fmx_cols() + 
  
  labs(x = "", y = "Bond Yields", caption = "Note:\nCalculation own",
       
       title = "Bond Yields in South Africa across the 3 month, 2 year and 10 year maturities",
       
       subtitle = "") + 
  
  guides(color = F)
  

  fmxdat::finplot(SA_Bond_All, x.vert = T, x.date.type = "%Y", x.date.dist = "2 years")
  
```

A cursory analysis indicates that bond yields for all maturities have declined over the 20-year period examined. The largest decline is experienced by the shortest maturity. We are however, more interested in the spreads between bonds of different maturities.


```{r, echo=FALSE}

#Calculating the spreads on the different maturities
Bond_spreads <- SA_bonds %>% 
    
    mutate(spread3M10Yr = ZA_10Yr - SA_3M) %>% 
    
    mutate(spread3M2Yr = ZA_2Yr - SA_3M)

#gather and tidy 
Bond_spreads_st <- Bond_spreads %>% 
    
                    select(date, spread3M10Yr, spread3M2Yr) %>% 
    
                    gather(Ticker, Spread, -date) %>% 
    
                     tbl2xts::tbl_xts(cols_to_xts = Spread, spread_by = Ticker) %>% 
    
                    tbl2xts::xts_tbl() %>% gather(Ticker, Spread, -date)
        
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
#bond spreads with the 3m bond yield as the reference point 
Bond_spreads_st %>% ggplot +
    
                geom_line(aes(date, Spread, color = Ticker))+
    
                labs(title = "Mid and Long Term SA Spreads over shortest maturity", y = "Yield Spreads", x ="",
                     
                subtitle = "") +
    
                fmxdat::theme_fmx(title.size = ggpts(25), subtitle.size = ggpts(20)) + 
    
                fmxdat::fmx_cols()



```

Evidently, the spread between the shortest dated maturity and the mid and longer termed bonds have widened recently. The divergence seems to have started in late 2018 and has continued to have widened since.

```{r}
usdzar %>% ggplot() + geom_line(aes(date, Price, color = Name)) +
    
                    labs(title = "ZAR USD Exchange Rate", y = "ZAR/USD", x ="", 
                          
                    subtitle = "DMTMKGWM" ) +
    
                    fmxdat::theme_fmx(title.size = ggpts(25), subtitle.size = ggpts(18), legend.size = 
                                           
                    ggpts(15)) + 
    
                    fmxdat::fmx_cols()

                           

```

A crucial driver of the ZAR is South Africa's attractiveness as a carry-trade investment position. Our functioning and liquid bond market has allowed our ZAR to remain relatively stable, and banded within a certain range, opposed ot other EM currencies. A weakening ZAR relative to the USD may result in an increase in SA as a carry-trade destination so long as US rates do not experience a hike.
